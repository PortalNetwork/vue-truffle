        <p>Portal Network is excited to announce that we will be part of Wanchain Asia Tour 2018 in Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea! We believe that this will be a crucial milestone and we highly appreciate this opportunity that Wanchain provide. This Asia tour will be celebrating the launch of WANCHAIN MAIN NET 2.0 together with many other partners and Portal Network will be there to reveal our latest update on WNS (Wanchain Name Service). Most of the people will find it hard to access to the decentralized websites or application due to the technology limitation that blockchain is facing at the current stage. To solve this problem, Portal Network have been working hard on connecting and enhancing crucial blockchain technologies.</p>
